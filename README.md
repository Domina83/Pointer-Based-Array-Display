C++

📋 Description

The program:

Declares and initializes an integer array

Uses a pointer to traverse the array

Prints each element using pointer dereferencing

🧪 Sample Output

The entered elements are:

1

5

🛠️ How to Run

Compile with a C++ compiler like g++:

g++ pointer_array.cpp -o pointer_array
./pointer_array
